# MaterialFox Fixes

Those are design fixes that fixes random unconsistency of padding, more chrome-like animations, wrong centering, etc..

You can find more details in the `fixes.css` file.

Some of those fixes were copied from [kbc8090's firefox material theme](https://github.com/kbc8090/firefox), thanks to him!

## Installation

Follow the instructions in the [MaterialFox README](https://github.com/edelvarden/material-fox-updated/blob/main/README.md) to install the theme.

Then, copy the `fixes.css` file into your Firefox profile directory alongside `chrome/userContent.css`.
You can find your Firefox profile directory by going to `about:profiles` in Firefox and looking for the "Root Directory" of your profile.

And finally, add the following line to your `userContent.css` file:

```css
@import "fixes.css";
```
